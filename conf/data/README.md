# Updating the Reference Data Files

There are several reference tables, all supplied as CSV files. They are in pairs covering the local custodian
names.

They are keyed on the Local Custodian Code. For each pair of files, there must be the same number of codes,
and the codes must match between the two files.

Both files may contain one or more header lines.

## local_custodian_table.csv

This was obtained from the Ordnance Survey website, then manually converted from the Word document to a CSV file.

## islands_local_custodian_table.csv

This was obtained from the Ordnance Survey website, then manually converted from the Word document to a CSV file.
